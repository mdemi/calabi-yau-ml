# calabi-yau-ml
This repo contains a simplified implementation of the supervised ML algorithm described in Section 5 of https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01730.

In summary, we first generate a dataset of Calabi-Yau (CY) hypersurfaces in toric varieties using CYTools (https://cy.tools/). We then use the GKZ vectors corresponding to each triangulation (see paper for a definition and more information) as features and train a neural network to predict the volume of the CY at the tip of the stretched Kahler cone.

## Model
The deep learning model is a fully connected neural network with residual connections that is initialized to implement the identity operation prior to training. For more information, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04887.

## Dataset
We pick a reflexive polytope with h11=30 from the Kreuzer-Skarke dataset and generate 1,000,000 unique Calabi-Yau phases using CYTools. We seperate this set into a training set (80%) and testing set (20%), making sure that the same phase of the Calabi-Yau manifold does not appear in both sets. 

## Notes
I prioritized simplicity and user-friendliness whenever possible. As such, the implementation here differs from the original implementation in a few ways:

1- We use CYTools to generate the dataset. As the original study predates the creation of CYTools, the dataset was generated by a collection of scripts containing the core algorithms that were eventually combined in CYTools.

2- We implement the deep learning model in PyTorch, while the original study used Tensorflow.

3- The dataset is processed in-memory and saved in csv files, while the original study used MongoDB, calculated statistics out-of-memory and saved the datasets as .tfrecord files.
