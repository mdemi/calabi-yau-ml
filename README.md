# calabi-yau-ml
This repo contains a greatly simplified implementation of the supervised ML algorithm described in Section 5 of https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01730.

In short, we use GKZ phi vectors as features and train a new neural network to predict geometric/physical quantities of interest, in this case the volume of a Calabi-Yau manifold at the tip of the stretched Kahler cone.
